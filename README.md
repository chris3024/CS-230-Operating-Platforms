#### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client is The Gaming Room, which has an application called "Draw it or Lose it" that is currently available for the Android ecosystem. The client wants to turn this into a platform independent design to allow for the expansion of the player base. The requirement for this software is that be compatible on many different platforms, to be secure and actively protect the players personal data, and for the teams to consist of multiple players with unique identifiers. 

#### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  The thing that I fell I did particularly well in preparing this document is transferring the information that was given to me by the client into a better outline for what the client would like to achieve with this application. This allowed me to communicate to the client important information that can help with the development. 
  
#### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  While working through the document, it allowed for me to take the development step by step and to create a product that the client will find useful in their endeavor. 
  
#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I had to choose one part of the document to revise, I believe that I would revise the chart listing the pros and cons of the different development platforms to include more information that the client may find useful. 
  
#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I interpreted the needs of the user in that of data protection. By protecting the user’s data, it gives the user an ease of mind to know that their data is safe from possible intrusion by an outside force.
  
#### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  Prior to this course, I had not even considered what went it to the designing and implementing software for an end user besides myself. This has opened my eye to things that I need to consider when designing my own applications.
